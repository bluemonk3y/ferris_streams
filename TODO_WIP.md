---

# 📋 **NUMBERED DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES**

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE 1: SQL-FIRST DOCUMENTATION RESTRUCTURE** ⚡ **TOP PRIORITY**
**Status**: 🔴 **URGENT** - Critical for new user adoption and onboarding
**Timeline**: Week 1-2 implementation required
**Impact**: **HIGHEST** - Directly affects new user success rate

### 🚨 **CRITICAL PROBLEM**
- **SQL Reference Guide is 4,587 lines** - Overwhelming for new users
- **New users can't find basic examples** - Documentation is scattered across 80+ files
- **No clear "Hello World" experience** - Users struggle to write first query
- **Task-oriented organization missing** - Users can't find "how to do X" easily

### 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**
- **Time to first successful query: Under 2 minutes**
- **Time to productive usage: Under 10 minutes**
- **Documentation sections used by 80% of new users: 3-4 sections maximum**

### 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

#### **Phase 1: Create New SQL-First Structure (Week 1)**

1. **Create Primary Entry Point**
   ```
   docs/sql/README.md - "Your First Query in 2 Minutes"
   ```
   **Content Requirements:**
   - Working SELECT query example in first 30 seconds
   - Copy-paste Kafka setup in 1 minute
   - 3 most common query patterns with real data
   - Quick navigation to task-oriented sections
   - **NO THEORY** - Only working code examples

2. **Extract Quick Start Content**
   ```
   docs/sql/quickstart/
   ├── hello-world.md       # Basic SELECT, WHERE, LIMIT (from lines 40-100)
   ├── basic-filtering.md   # AND, OR, BETWEEN examples (from lines 62-200)
   ├── simple-aggregation.md # COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY (from lines 500-800)
   └── joins-101.md         # Basic stream joins (from JOIN_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md)
   ```

3. **Create Task-Oriented Sections**
   ```
   docs/sql/by-task/
   ├── filter-data.md       # WHERE clauses, complex conditions
   ├── aggregate-data.md    # GROUP BY, aggregation functions
   ├── join-streams.md      # Stream joins with real examples
   ├── window-analysis.md   # Time windows (TUMBLING, SLIDING, SESSION)
   ├── detect-patterns.md   # Pattern detection and alerting
   └── transform-data.md    # Data transformation queries
   ```

4. **Split Function Reference**
   ```
   docs/sql/functions/
   ├── README.md           # Quick function lookup table
   ├── essential.md        # Top 10 most-used functions with examples
   ├── aggregation.md      # SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX
   ├── string.md          # SUBSTRING, CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, REGEXP
   ├── date-time.md       # DATE functions, INTERVAL arithmetic
   ├── math.md            # Mathematical operations and calculations
   ├── window.md          # ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD, NTILE
   ├── json.md            # JSON processing and extraction
   └── advanced.md        # Complex and specialized functions
   ```

#### **Phase 2: Real-World Examples (Week 2)**

5. **Create Copy-Paste Examples**
   ```
   docs/sql/examples/
   ├── real-time-dashboard.md    # Dashboard queries for metrics
   ├── fraud-detection.md        # Fraud detection patterns and alerts
   ├── iot-analytics.md          # IoT sensor data analysis
   ├── financial-trading.md      # Trading analytics and risk management
   ├── user-behavior.md          # User behavior analysis and segmentation
   └── operational-monitoring.md # System monitoring and alerting queries
   ```

   **Each example must include:**
   - Complete working query
   - Sample data setup
   - Expected output
   - Common variations
   - Performance considerations

#### **Phase 3: Reorganize Supporting Documentation**

6. **Streamline Data Sources Documentation**
   ```
   docs/data/
   ├── kafka-quick-setup.md     # 5-minute Kafka setup
   ├── file-data.md            # CSV/JSON file processing
   ├── schemas.md              # Schema configuration essentials
   └── formats.md              # Serialization format guide
   ```

7. **Update Root Documentation**
   ```
   docs/
   ├── README.md               # SQL examples in first 100 lines
   ├── QUICK_START.md         # Complete 5-minute tutorial
   ├── SQL_REFERENCE.md       # Reorganized master reference
   └── SQL_EXAMPLES.md        # Most common patterns
   ```

   - Emit mode concepts
   - EMIT CHANGES vs EMIT ALL
   - Late data handling
   - Watermark configuration

7. **From SQL_REFERENCE_GROUP_BY.md (202 lines)** → Merge into `docs/sql/by-task/aggregate-data.md`

### 🎯 **VALIDATION CRITERIA**

**Before marking complete, verify:**

1. **New User Test**: Someone unfamiliar with FerrisStreams can write their first query in under 2 minutes using only the new documentation
2. **Task Completion Test**: Users can find and complete these tasks in under 5 minutes each:
   - Filter streaming data by multiple conditions
   - Create a simple aggregation query
   - Join two data streams
   - Set up time-based windows
3. **Copy-Paste Test**: All examples work without modification
4. **Navigation Test**: Users can find any common task in under 30 seconds

### 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS**
1. **Create `docs/sql/` directory structure**
2. **Write `docs/sql/README.md` with 2-minute getting started experience**
3. **Extract hello-world content from massive SQL reference**
4. **Build first task-oriented guide (filter-data.md)**

**This restructure is THE TOP PRIORITY** as it directly impacts new user adoption and time-to-value. All other objectives should be paused until this critical user experience improvement is complete.
