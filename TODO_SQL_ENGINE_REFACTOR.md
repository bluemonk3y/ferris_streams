# SQL Engine Refactor TODO List

**Current Branch**: `34-refactor-sqlengine-attempt2`  
**Purpose**: Complete the SQL engine refactoring work (architectural improvements, cleanup, optimization)  
**Status**: **IN PROGRESS** - Core refactoring 85% complete, cleanup tasks remaining

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK (For Reference)

### Core Refactoring (Phases 1-5B) - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1**: API Cleanup - Internal types hidden, methods made private
- **Phase 2**: Extract Core Types - FieldValue, StreamRecord extracted to separate files
- **Phase 3**: Extract Expression Engine - Expression evaluation, functions, arithmetic separated
- **Phase 4**: Extract Aggregation Engine - GROUP BY, accumulator logic separated  
- **Phase 5**: Extract Query Processors - SELECT, JOIN, LIMIT, WINDOW processors created
- **Phase 5B**: Enable Processor Execution - All SELECT queries now use processor architecture

### Advanced Features (Phase 6.1-6.2) - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- **Phase 6.1**: Window Functions - 28/28 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Phase 6.2**: Advanced GROUP BY Features - 40/40 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Phase 6.5**: DML Operations - INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE fully implemented (43/43 tests passing)
- **Phase 6.5**: Schema Introspection - SHOW/DESCRIBE operations (15/15 tests passing)

### Core Subquery Infrastructure - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- **SubqueryExecutor Trait**: Architecture for processor-based subquery execution
- **Data Source Integration**: ProcessorContext enhancement with test data sources
- **Mock Implementations Replaced**: Real subquery execution with 13/13 core tests passing
- **Unique Error IDs**: All mock error messages now have tracking IDs

## üöß REMAINING REFACTOR TASKS

### **Phase 6.4: Performance Optimizations** ‚è≥ **READY TO START**
- [ ] **Re-benchmark Performance Tests** - Now that real subqueries are implemented
  - Re-run processor vs legacy benchmarks with real subquery execution
  - Measure subquery performance impact on overall query execution  
  - Identify any performance bottlenecks introduced by real implementations
- [ ] **Optimize Subquery Execution** 
  - Implement subquery result caching if beneficial
  - Optimize data source access patterns
  - Reduce memory allocation in subquery processing
- [ ] **Update Performance Documentation**
  - Document realistic performance characteristics with real subqueries
  - Update benchmarking results with accurate numbers
  - Provide performance tuning guidelines

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days  
**Prerequisites**: Subquery implementation complete ‚úÖ  

### **Phase 6.3: Legacy Engine Cleanup** ‚è≥ **READY TO START**
- [ ] **Remove Unused Legacy Subquery Methods**
  - Remove old mock subquery implementations from engine.rs
  - Clean up `evaluate_subquery`, `execute_scalar_subquery`, `execute_exists_subquery` methods
  - Remove `evaluate_in_subquery` and related helper methods
- [ ] **Remove Unused Legacy GROUP BY Methods**
  - Remove old GROUP BY implementation methods (now handled by processors)
  - Clean up `update_group_accumulator_inline`, `compute_group_result_fields`
  - Remove legacy aggregation helper methods
- [ ] **Remove Compiler Warning Methods** 
  - Remove methods flagged as "never used" by compiler
  - Clean up `create_mock_right_record`, `field_value_compare`
  - Remove unused arithmetic and comparison helpers
- [ ] **Clean Up Feature Flag System**
  - Remove any remaining feature flags once all functionality is migrated
  - Simplify routing logic where possible

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day  
**Prerequisites**: Performance optimization complete, all features migrated  

### **Phase 6.7: Final Refactor Cleanup** ‚è≥ **BLOCKED BY 6.3-6.4**
- [ ] **Final Code Review and Documentation**
  - Review all processor implementations for consistency
  - Update architecture documentation with final state
  - Ensure all public APIs are properly documented
- [ ] **Improve Error Messages and Debugging**
  - Standardize error message format across all processors
  - Add consistent logging and tracing support
  - Improve debugging information for complex queries
- [ ] **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Run comprehensive linting and formatting
  - Address any remaining code quality issues
  - Optimize imports and module organization
- [ ] **Remove Backup Files**
  - Clean up `execution_bak.rs` if no longer needed
  - Remove any temporary files or unused modules

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day  
**Prerequisites**: Phases 6.3 and 6.4 complete

## üìã **REFACTOR PR CHECKLIST**

### **Before Merging This Branch:**
- [ ] Phase 6.4: Performance optimizations complete
- [ ] Phase 6.3: Legacy cleanup complete  
- [ ] Phase 6.7: Final cleanup complete
- [ ] All tests passing (currently 703/705, targeting 705/705 after remaining functionality)
- [ ] No performance regression measured
- [ ] Clean codebase with no unused method warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed

### **Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ **Modular Architecture**: SQL engine split into logical, maintainable modules
- ‚úÖ **Clean API**: Public API clearly separated from internal implementation
- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: All existing functionality preserved with comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: No performance regression, ideally some improvements
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented, properly organized codebase

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS**

1. **Start Phase 6.4** - Performance optimizations now that real subqueries are implemented
2. **Run comprehensive benchmarks** - Measure real-world performance with subqueries
3. **Complete Phase 6.3** - Remove unused legacy methods and warnings
4. **Final Phase 6.7** - Polish and document the completed refactor

This refactor branch focuses on **architectural improvements, performance optimization, and code cleanup** rather than new functionality.
