# FerrisStreams GROUP BY Implementation TODO

This document tracks the progress and remaining work for the GROUP BY implementation in FerrisStreams SQL engine.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive GROUP BY operations with streaming semantics following Apache Flink's emission model.

**Current Status**: 20/20 tests passing (100% success rate) - Core functionality complete, all aggregate functions implemented and tested, windowing working, NULL handling implemented.

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks (10/16)

1. **Research Flink's GROUP BY emission model** ✅
   - Studied Flink's continuous emission strategy with retraction semantics
   - Implemented result deduplication that keeps only latest result per group key

2. **Implement Flink-style continuous emission strategy** ✅
   - Added stateful GROUP BY with `GroupByState` and `GroupAccumulator` structs
   - Implemented streaming aggregation with proper group state management
   - Added `handle_group_by_record()` method for individual record processing

3. **Fix result deduplication for test compatibility** ✅
   - Created `collect_latest_group_results()` function for Flink-style result collection
   - Fixed test compatibility issues where tests expected final results but got intermediate emissions

4. **Debug missing aggregation fields issue** ✅
   - Fixed type mismatch between `InternalValue::Integer` and `InternalValue::Number` in tests
   - Ensured all aggregate fields (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX) appear correctly in results

5. **Fix boolean grouping issue** ✅
   - Added comprehensive binary operator support in `evaluate_expression_static()`
   - Implemented comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, != for FieldValue types
   - Fixed boolean expression evaluation for dynamic GROUP BY expressions

6. **Fix HAVING clause field resolution** ✅
   - Enhanced `find_field_by_suffix()` to handle both exact matches and suffix patterns
   - Fixed HAVING clause field lookup for aggregate function aliases (e.g., `SUM(amount) as total`)

7. **Fix WINDOW parser issue** ✅
   - Added INTERVAL syntax support in `parse_duration_token()` method
   - Fixed parsing for `WINDOW TUMBLING(INTERVAL 5 MINUTES)` syntax
   - Added proper time unit conversion (MINUTES→m, SECONDS→s, etc.)

8. **Fix windowed GROUP BY test (test_group_by_with_window)** ✅
   - Fixed execute method to properly route windowed queries through windowed processing pipeline
   - Added FieldValue::Float support in extract_event_time for proper timestamp handling
   - Enhanced window state initialization for direct execute() calls
   - Added window flushing in tests to ensure all windows are emitted
   - **Result**: 11/11 tests passing (100% success rate), Flink-style windowing working correctly

9. **Add tests for missing aggregate functions** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Added**: STDDEV, VARIANCE, FIRST, LAST, STRING_AGG, COUNT_DISTINCT
   - **Implementation**: Fixed missing computation path in `compute_field_aggregate_value()`
   - **Tests Added**: 6 comprehensive test functions covering all missing aggregate functions
   - **Features**: Sample standard deviation/variance, dynamic separator support for STRING_AGG, proper NULL handling
   - **Result**: 17/17 tests passing (100% success rate), all 13/13 aggregate functions now working

10. **Add NULL value handling tests in GROUP BY operations** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - **Added**: 3 comprehensive NULL handling test functions
    - **Tests**: NULL values in grouping expressions, NULL handling in aggregate functions, complex multi-column NULL scenarios
    - **Implementation**: Enhanced GroupAccumulator with `non_null_counts` field, fixed COUNT(column) vs COUNT(*) distinction
    - **Features**: Proper SQL-standard NULL handling - NULLs group together, aggregates ignore NULLs (except COUNT(*))
    - **Result**: 20/20 tests passing (100% success rate), complete NULL handling for all GROUP BY operations

### ❌ Pending Tasks (6/16)

#### **Edge Case Testing**
11. **Add edge case tests: empty result sets, mixed data types, large group counts** 🧪
    - Empty result sets from WHERE clauses
    - Mixed data types in aggregation columns
    - High-cardinality grouping (memory pressure testing)

12. **Add complex expression tests in GROUP BY** 🧪
    - Mathematical calculations in GROUP BY expressions
    - Function calls in GROUP BY expressions
    - Nested expressions and operator precedence

#### **Error Handling**
13. **Add error scenario tests: invalid aggregations, nested aggregations** 🧪
    - Non-aggregate columns not in GROUP BY (should fail)
    - Nested aggregate functions (should fail)
    - Invalid aggregate function usage

#### **Integration Testing**
14. **Add integration tests: GROUP BY with JOINs, subqueries, UNION** 🧪
    - GROUP BY with different JOIN types
    - GROUP BY in subqueries
    - GROUP BY with UNION operations

#### **Performance Testing**
15. **Add performance/stress tests: high-cardinality grouping, large volumes** 🧪
    - Memory usage patterns with many groups
    - Performance with large record volumes
    - Streaming performance characteristics

#### **Validation**
16. **Verify comprehensive test coverage (target: 25+ tests)** 📊
    - Current: 20 tests
    - Target: 25+ tests for production confidence
    - Ensure all code paths are tested
