A Rust-idiomatic and robust client library for Apache Kafka, designed for high-performance, fault-tolerant, and flexible processing of **multiple Kafka topics and data streams**.

## üåü Features

* **Asynchronous Kafka Interaction:** Built on `rdkafka` & `tokio` for efficient, non-blocking I/O with Kafka brokers.
* **Comprehensive Client Support:** Includes robust implementations for:
    * **Producers:** Reliably send messages to Kafka topics.
    * **Consumers:** Efficiently consume messages from Kafka, supporting group management.
    * **Parallel Consumers:** Leverage concurrent processing for high-throughput message handling across multiple partitions and topics.
* **Flexible Serialization/Deserialization (`serde`):** Provides a modular `serde` framework, with out-of-the-box support for JSON and extensible traits for custom formats (e.g., Avro, Protobuf via feature flags).
* **KTable-like Stateful Processing:** Build and manage local, fault-tolerant state stores for stream processing applications, enabling aggregations, joins, and materializing views across various input streams.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Utilizes `thiserror` for precise, user-friendly error types and `anyhow` for convenient error propagation.
* **Configurable and Extensible:** Designed with builder patterns and traits to allow for easy customization and integration.
