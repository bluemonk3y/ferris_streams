# Remaining SQL Functionality TODO List

**Purpose**: Complete remaining SQL functionality (new features, edge cases, advanced capabilities)  
**Target Branch**: New feature branches (separate PRs)  
**Status**: **2 remaining test failures** + **future enhancements**

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES** (2 Test Failures - 99.7% ‚Üí 100%)

### **Current Status**: 703/705 tests passing (99.7% success rate)

### **FEATURE A: INSERT ... SELECT Implementation** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Failed Test**: `unit::sql::execution::processors::dml::insert_test::test_insert_select`  
**Issue**: `INSERT INTO table SELECT ...` returns "not yet implemented" error  
**Location**: `src/ferris/sql/execution/processors/insert.rs:144-147`

#### **Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] **A1: Analyze Parser Support**
  - Check if parser correctly handles `INSERT INTO table SELECT ...` syntax
  - Verify AST nodes capture SELECT subquery properly in `InsertSource::Select`
  - Document any parser limitations or missing features
  
- [ ] **A2: Design Result Materialization**
  - Design how SELECT results are materialized for INSERT operations
  - Plan memory management for large result sets (streaming vs buffering)
  - Define interfaces between SELECT execution and INSERT processing
  
- [ ] **A3: Implement SELECT Execution in INSERT Context**
  - Execute the SELECT subquery using existing `SelectProcessor`
  - Handle data source resolution for SELECT within INSERT context
  - Manage `ProcessorContext` properly for nested query execution
  
- [ ] **A4: Implement Column Mapping**
  - Map SELECT result columns to INSERT target columns by position
  - Handle explicit column lists: `INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) SELECT ...`
  - Handle implicit mapping when no columns specified
  
- [ ] **A5: Add Validation and Type Conversion**
  - Validate SELECT result column count matches INSERT columns
  - Implement type conversion between SELECT results and target schema
  - Handle compatible type conversions (int‚Üífloat, string coercion, etc.)
  
- [ ] **A6: Error Handling**
  - Handle empty SELECT results (should succeed with 0 insertions)
  - Validate target table exists and is writable
  - Provide context-aware error messages
  
- [ ] **A7: Complete Implementation**
  - Replace "not yet implemented" error with real logic in `process_select_insert()`
  - Integrate all components (execution, mapping, validation)
  - Add logging and comprehensive testing

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: HIGH (Blocks 100% test success rate)

### **FEATURE B: Advanced JOIN with Subqueries in ON Conditions** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Failed Test**: `unit::sql::execution::processors::join::subquery_join_test::test_right_join_with_not_exists_in_on_condition`  
**Issue**: `RIGHT JOIN ... ON condition AND NOT EXISTS (...)` fails during subquery evaluation  
**Context**: Complex JOIN operations with subqueries in ON conditions not fully supported

#### **Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] **B1: Analyze Parser Support**
  - Verify parser handles complex ON conditions with subqueries
  - Check AST representation of `AND NOT EXISTS (...)` in ON clauses
  - Test parsing of various subquery types in ON conditions
  
- [ ] **B2: Design JOIN Context Enhancement**
  - Extend `JoinContext` or create new context for subquery evaluation
  - Plan how current record context flows to subqueries in ON conditions
  - Design correlation variable binding for subqueries (`u.id`, `p.owner_id`)
  
- [ ] **B3: Update JoinProcessor**
  - Modify JOIN condition evaluation to detect and handle subqueries
  - Integrate with existing `SubqueryExecutor` trait in JOIN processors
  - Update `ExpressionEvaluator::evaluate_expression_with_subqueries` usage
  
- [ ] **B4: Implement RIGHT JOIN Logic**
  - Ensure RIGHT JOIN semantics preserved with subquery conditions
  - Handle cases where subquery evaluation affects JOIN matching
  - Test with LEFT, INNER, and FULL OUTER JOINs as well
  
- [ ] **B5: Handle Complex Correlation**
  - Support correlated subqueries referencing both JOIN tables
  - Manage variable scope: `WHERE user_id = u.id AND resource = 'products'`
  - Implement proper field resolution for correlated references
  
- [ ] **B6: Error Handling**
  - Handle subquery execution failures in JOIN context
  - Provide meaningful error messages with JOIN and subquery context
  - Add unique error IDs for JOIN subquery errors
  
- [ ] **B7: Comprehensive Testing**
  - Test all JOIN types with subqueries (LEFT, INNER, FULL OUTER)
  - Add comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
  - Performance test with complex JOIN subquery scenarios

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Priority**: HIGH (Blocks 100% test success rate)  
**Complexity**: Higher than Feature A (requires correlation and context management)

## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION ORDER**

### **Recommended Sequence**:
1. **Feature A (INSERT ... SELECT)** - Implement first
   - Simpler architecture using existing SelectProcessor
   - Mainly requires result materialization and column mapping
   - Less complex than JOIN subquery correlation

2. **Feature B (JOIN with ON subqueries)** - Implement second
   - More complex integration with expression evaluation
   - Requires sophisticated correlation and context management
   - Builds on lessons learned from Feature A

### **Success Criteria**:
- **Feature A Complete**: `test_insert_select` passes, INSERT ... SELECT fully functional
- **Feature B Complete**: `test_right_join_with_not_exists_in_on_condition` passes
- **Overall Goal**: **705/705 tests passing (100% success rate)** üéØ

## üöÄ **PROJECT IMPACT**

**Current State**: World-class streaming SQL engine with 99.7% functionality complete  
**Remaining Work**: 2 advanced edge cases to achieve 100% SQL compliance  
**Future Potential**: Foundation for enterprise-grade streaming SQL capabilities

The remaining work represents **advanced edge cases** rather than core functionality gaps. The SQL engine is already **production-ready** for the vast majority of use cases!
